		<li>There is no eligibility requirement in terms of number of backlogs.</li>
		<li>There is no CGPA criterion for registration.</li>
		<li>Departments can set their own maximum number of students that can avail this option.</li>
        <li>You can apply starting from 4th Semester.</li>
        <li>In case the student from your department wants to pursue an option in your department, you can inform/seek approval from the Faculty 
            advisor. Further, the advisor should inform the academic section.
        </li>

        <li>After enrolling into majors, if a student gets FS/FR grade in more than 3 credits

		<li>A student must have cleared all outstanding backlogs by the time of enrolment into Minors/Honors</li>
		<li>There is no CGPA criterion for Minor. However, a CGPA criterion for Honors can be set by the respective Departments.</li>
		<li>To avoid overloading, departments offering Minor/Honors can put an upper limit on the
            number of Minor/honor students they wish to take. The students have to understand that since
            the number of seats available for each of the program will always be limited, one has to
            compete for a place; he/she thus cannot ignore the basic CGPA.</li>
		<li>A student can enroll for Minor in fifth semester only. There is no CGPA criterion for
            enrolling into a Minor. A student can enroll for Honors in fifth or sixth semester, depending
            on the policy of the department. The department can plan the Honors from fifth or sixth
            semester. There is no CGPA criterion for enrolling into Honors at institute level.</li>
        <li>You can inform/seek approval from Faculty advisor in case the student from your department wants to pursue an option in another department.</li>

        <li>After enrolling into Minors/Honors, if a student gets FS/FR grade in more than 3 credits
            his/her enrolment to the same will be terminated.</li>
        <li>If a student has done the required courses as free electives before, you can make up for the lost credits on a case by case basis on recommendation of DUGC convener.</li>
        <li>Minor and major cannot be done in the same department. Student can enroll for both Minor & Honors or for 2 Minors.</li>

            basket of courses prescribed for each minor stream.</li>
        <li>In order to earn honors, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits out of
            which six credits from project work and at least six credits are from courses offered
            by the student’s major department. These can change as per department guidelines.</li>
        <li>The final transcript will only show the basic CGPA corresponding to the minimum
            requirement for the degree. The Minors/Honors will be indicated by a separate CGPA.

            In such cases, the student may choose between the actual grade or a “pass(P)” grade
            and also choose to omit the mention of the course as for the following: All the courses
            done under the dropped Minor/Honors will be shown in the transcript. None of the
